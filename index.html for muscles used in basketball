   <h1>What muscles are used in basketball?</h1>
   <ul>
    <li>Triceps: Your tricep is the muscle located on the back of your upper arm. In the sport of basketball your tricep is extremely important because it controls the function of your elbow extension. The stronger your triceps are, the more power and control you have over your shots. 
    <br /><br />
    </li>
    <li>Quadriceps and hamstrings: The quadriceps are the powerful muscles at the front of your thighs and your hamstrings are the muscles behind your leg that run from your thigh to your knee. These muscles work together to produce more force in your vertical jump. Vertical jumping is extremely important in basketball because it controls your dunking, rebounding, blocking, contesting and finishing capability.
     <br /><br /> 
      </li>
      <li>Core: The core muscles stabilize all of your body movements while playing basketball by keeping your spine and hip joints in alignment. Basketball is a heavily coordinated sport which is why your core muscles are extremely important. They also help stabilize your balance which is crucial towards playing tight and quick defense as well as being shifty and hard to guard on offense.
       <br /><br />
        </li>
       <li>Forearm muscles: These muscles are located slightly above your wrist. Your forearms help control your wrist function as well as their power. This is very crucial towards the rotation of the ball behind your shot as well as the power behind your dribble moves. Without strong forearms it would be extremely difficult to maintain a consistent jumpshot.
      </li>
    </ul>
